## ReadMore! ##
  Simplifying reading
  An app to help you find something to read on new and interesting subjects

## Purpose ##
  We use Google Books' API to make suggestions based on the interests you give us, ten results at a time. You can also click on the book's title to bring you to its page on Google Books, with your interests highlighted. From there

## Your Problem ##
  For when you want to read something new, but are either out of ideas or overwhelmed by choices.

## Our Solution ##
  Just tell us what you're interested in, and we'll use the Google Books API to go and find you ten books on the subject with title, author, cover image, and descriptions when available. If you like the looks of any of them, just click the title and you'll be taken to the Google Books page. You'll find your interests highlighted there, and links to buy or download the book.
